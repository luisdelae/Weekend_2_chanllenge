#Weekend Challenge 02

Weekend Challenge 02
Welcome to your second weekend challenge! This week we will be building a carousel viewing application to display data we have requested from the server with AJAX.

Instructions
I created a new JSON data file and inside it you will find an array of objects. Each object represents one of you. It includes your name, your favorite movies, and favorite song as supplied.

You first task is to examine the AJAX call from the client side app.js (/public/scripts/app.js). It is set up to make an AJAX request to the node server on your computer. The $.ajax( ) call is set to use the GET type, and accesses the '/data' url. When successful, it should bring the data back to the application. You will need to build a carousel interface to display this data.

What I would like to see on the DOM, is one person represented. A series of 22 (or the number of people in the cohort) index points with the first person's index highlighted or called out in style differently than the others. Also on the DOM should be a 'next' and 'prev' button. Clicking on the next button should navigate to the next person, clicking on the prev button should navigate to the previous person. The highlighted index point should update also as you click next and prev.

Use this mockup drawing as a guide.

When a person is displayed, show their name, their favorite movies, and favorite song. Only one person should be showcased at any given time.

You will need to combine everything you learned this week to accomplish this task, and each of the challenges you have completed this week play a part in this task.

HARD MODE

Include a fade out and fade in animation in-between transitioning people.

PRO MODE

Include a timer that moves to the next person if the user is not clicking on next or prev. If the user clicks on next or prev, the timer should be reset. The timer should transition between people every 10 seconds.

MASTER MODE

Head over to the json file, and include a 'imageURL' property for each person. Then, manually head over to GitHub and right click on each person's user image and select 'COPY IMAGE URL'. Then past that into the 'imageURL' property. Display the new image information on the DOM, so that the person's GitHub image appears above their name. This will give you some experience in working with JSON and give you a better idea of how data is put together for distribution.
